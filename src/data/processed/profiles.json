Quase tudo digital. Desta vez, para produzir o “Fest Band – Amplificando a Cena”, que tem em seu cerne, o objetivo de estar a serviço do fomento da cena musical local, colaborando para que a classe artística se reestabeleça depois do arrasador ano de 2020.A programação prevê ações que mitiguem os impactos da Covid-19 no setor musical local. Para isso, propõe atividades que remunerem (e arrecadem mais recursos) para o maior número possível de profissionais da cena musical que já passaram pelo festival. A proposta é uma edição histórica, com as 24 bandas (99 músicos) da região que mais se destacaram nas últimas duas edições (essas que marcaram a retomada do festival), além de técnicos, produtores e demais profissionais envolvidos (que somarão, ao menos 40 pessoas).\nCertifications: INTRODUÇÃO À COMUNICAÇÃO NA ERA DIGITAL, Introdução à Libras, Intensivo de Design Gráfico, Cultura da Convergência, Planeje sua Liberdade, Comunicação Eficaz, Criatividade\nVolunteer: Coletivo Socioambiental Atibaia at Editor de vídeo",

[Banking] (Jan 2019–Present) | Full stack consultant at ABN AMRO Bank N.V. [Banking] (Jun 2015–Dec 2018) I am member of a Scrum team. I deal with the management of RESTful web services for home banking functionalities. The web services are consumed by a web application. My main responsibility is the back end but some of the frontend functionalities are developed by me. Used technologies are: Java, Spring, AngularJS, Hibernate, Websphere, Maven | System Integrator at PLUS Retail (Mar 2017–Dec 2018) I am involved in the development of the Plus Supermarket app. I am responsible of the communications between apps and the back end components.

I created a middle-ware written using NodeJS with a mongo persistent layer. NodeJS, mongoDB, security protocols over HTTP | System Integrator at MOBGEN | Accenture Interactive (Feb 2014–Dec 2018) My task was the integration of systems and their management. As the API and apps economy continues to evolve, a design problem arises for API designers when internal systems are too complex to expose directly to app developers. The goal of an API Facade Pattern is to articulate those internal systems and make them useful and consumable by app developers. I used APIGEE to create api facade. Sometimes I had to work with different technologies to plan and to understand how to integrate the systems. In APIGEE (backendside), often I used Java and javascript to manage the requests/responses from/to clients. Clients were mobile apps (iOS or Android). I helped the frontend developers to reach the backend interfaces. Sometimes, I created Android prototypes to facilitate the frontend tasks and to allow a better understanding of the interfaces of the backend. My last task was the integration of OAuth2 in a mobile app using of three IDPs (Google, Facebook and SinaWeibo) and an account manager (CloudMinder). | Software developer (intern) at R4I - Research for Innovation (Feb 2013–Dec 2013) | Consultant at Qadra (Jan 2010–Feb 2010)\nLanguages: Italiano, Inglese, Francese\nCertifications: ITIL® Foundation Certificate in IT Service Management, Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals",

I am investigating molecular, cellular, and genetic changes that occur in schizophrenia. I received my master's degree at the University of New Hampshire in neuroscience where I became proficient at basic molecular biology techniques as well as the organization, perseverance, and attention to detail necessary to complete scientific experiments.

In this regard, I value the team effort that is necessary for scientific advancement, but also feel very comfortable in an independent role. As a graduate student in neuroscience, I conducted independent research, managed a colony of transgenic mice, trained and supervised undergraduate students in the lab, and worked as a teaching assistant for both neuroscience and virology lab courses.

My role in this research was everything from the breeding of the transgenic mice that express a fluorescent protein in this specific cell population, cardiac perfusion and brain removal, brain slicing and immunohistochemistry, to analysis using confocal microscopy and ImageJ.

Na maanden van voorbereiding werd in 2010 de eerste vestiging van Brownies&downieS in Veghel geopend. De combinatie van kwalitatief goede gerechten in combinatie met de unieke service van de bijzondere medewerkers zorgde voor een nieuw uniek horeca concept. Dit concept bleek dan ook direct een doorslaand succes ondanks de zware tijden in de horeca. In de loop van 2011 ontstond daarom het idee om een tweede vestiging in de directe omgeving te openen. Dit idee werd verder uitgewerkt en zo werd in 2012 de tweede vestiging in Sint-Oedenrode geopend. Op dat moment waren er geen verdere groeiplannen en werd de focus door Thijs en Teun gelegd op de twee vestigingen. Dit veranderde toen Sander van Brussel in 2012 aanklopte bij Thijs en Teun met de vraag of hij een eigen vestiging kon openen. Vanuit deze vraag werd in 2012 besloten een franchiseformule te schrijven. Vanaf dat moment ging het hard, en werden verschillende vestigingen door franchisenemers geopend. Op moment van schrijven telt Brownies&downieS 40 vestigingen. Brownies&downieS heeft de doelstelling om in 2020 87 vestigingen te hebben verdeeld over heel Nederland en België. Door onze interesse in het concept zijn Rutger Kanis en ik in maart 2016 in contact gekomen met Brownies&downieS. Wat begon met een idee is werkelijkheid geworden, wij zijn een eigen vestiging in Zwolle begonnen! | Account Manager at Vila Etiketten B.V.

    "name": "Caleb Kirschman",
    "position": "Controls Software Engineer",
    "about": "My software career began in 2016 when an academic advisor told me it is easier to teach coding to a physicist than it is to teach a programmer physics. That was then nurtured by my research advisor for the next 3 years. Of course, it’s never easy practicing coding between physics classes and research, but with the right guidance, it can certainly be done. Shoutout to Dr. Nutter and Dr. Zacate who never let me take the easy way; I have been the better for it ever since. Not only does my unique foundation bring creative solutions to the industry, but also a discipline to ensure higher quality results. The practice often gets me labeled as an overachiever; however, I find doing a little extra work up front makes for less work overall. For example, as a DBA, I made it a habit to keep tabs on troublesome servers. Since naming conventions are not consistent, it was tedious keeping up with which server had what issue. But knowing the history of a server allowed me to combine past solutions into permanent resolutions. Once my team saw the results, I became one of our company’s preferred representatives for disaster-level recovery events within 6 months. But my DBA days are over (for now). I’m currently working as a Controls Software Engineer. I have learned a lot in the last decade and I believe that this job allows me to pool all my previous knowledge into a building block for my next challenge. From designing the architecture of new features to being hands on with machine diagnostics, there are many aspects of the process I must be familiar with. But I like a good puzzle, and balancing the demands of custom orders always brings something interesting through the door. Looking back, I am proud to say that I never backed down from a challenge. I am a self-motivated and self-made code monkey. I look forward with excitement for what I will accomplish next.",

    "embedding_text": "Name: Caleb Kirschman\nCurrent Position: Controls Software Engineer\nCurrent Company: Milacron\nLocation: Cincinnati, Ohio, United States, US\nAbout: My software career began in 2016 when an academic advisor told me it is easier to teach coding to a physicist than it is to teach a programmer physics. That was then nurtured by my research advisor for the next 3 years. Of course, it’s never easy practicing coding between physics classes and research, but with the right guidance, it can certainly be done. Shoutout to Dr. Nutter and Dr. Zacate who never let me take the easy way; I have been the better for it ever since. Not only does my unique foundation bring creative solutions to the industry, but also a discipline to ensure higher quality results. The practice often gets me labeled as an overachiever; however, I find doing a little extra work up front makes for less work overall. For example, as a DBA, I made it a habit to keep tabs on troublesome servers. Since naming conventions are not consistent, it was tedious keeping up with which server had what issue. But knowing the history of a server allowed me to combine past solutions into permanent resolutions. Once my team saw the results, I became one of our company’s preferred representatives for disaster-level recovery events within 6 months. But my DBA days are over (for now). I’m currently working as a Controls Software Engineer. I have learned a lot in the last decade and I believe that this job allows me to pool all my previous knowledge into a building block for my next challenge. From designing the architecture of new features to being hands on with machine diagnostics, there are many aspects of the process I must be familiar with. But I like a good puzzle, and balancing the demands of custom orders always brings something interesting through the door. Looking back, I am proud to say that I never backed down from a challenge. I am a self-motivated and self-made code monkey. I look forward with excitement for what I will accomplish next.\nInterests: research, analytics, academic\nEducation Details: Bachelor of Science - BS in Physics from Northern Kentucky University Major: Physics (2014–2018) | Minor in Mathematics from Northern Kentucky University Major: Mathematics, Minor: Mathematics (2014–2018)\nExperience Details: Controls Software Engineer at Milacron [Machinery Manufacturing] (Nov 2021–Present) Responsible for designing, writing, and implementing new software options for custom extrusion machines while supporting the machine's final validation including multi-system diagnostics.

When someone says that's the \"Real McCoy\" they are putting an emphasis on saying that what you have is the real thing. I want my business to reflect that which is why my website is www.atlantasrealmccoy.com . Buying a home for most people will be the most expensive purchase of their lives. Which in turn makes it one of the most stressful times in their lives. What someone needs during this time is a dedicated real estate agent who looks out for their best interest. People want someone who can handle the stress, not push them into something they don't want and a person they can trust. That's where I come into the picture. | Chemistry Teacher (Aug 2002–May 2013) Best known for my outside of the box thinking to present topics. From creating Chemistry Raps that got a few hits on youtube to coming up with the most memorable day in many of my students' high school career's (Chemistry Halloween) I constantly sought to bring Chemistry alive. I worked at Parkview from 2002-2012. While there I had a chance to teach all the core science classes (chemistry, physics, and biology). While I loved them all my true passion was for Chemistry. I taught at Norcross from 2012-2013.\nCertifications: Seller Representative Specialist\nVolunteer: Perimeter Church at Hospitality Team | Perimeter Church at Brick's Volunteer",

In this book, I begin with an introduction to the subfields of AI and gradually connect the dots between various subfields, to establish an intelligent Wi-Fi and/or 5G network. Artificial Intelligence for Wireless Networking' includes sections on: * Fundamentals of AI * User Experience Intelligence * Automated Wireless Network Operation * Active Security Protection * Implementing AI in your Network Although no one can predict what the future might hold, AI is blurring the lines between science fiction and scientific reality. This book delves into the possibilities of using brain-waves to fine tune the Wi-Fi/5G performance to user's psychological expectations. The examples in this book will leave your grey cells tickled, building your ability to think the AI-way! Often, AI is viewed as a potential threat to human jobs. To tackle this uncomfortable zone, I also address possible collaboration options with various AI Systems and the skills that will keep you relevant and in demand. This book will inspire, educate, and challenge you to use artificial intelligence not just for wireless networks but well beyond. This book is useful for anyone who wants to learn about AI or is looking to solve problems in the field of wireless networking.

Show less | Author (Apr 2009–Present) Author of Book RTLS For Dummies. Published by Wiley Publishing, Inc. This book gives you the whole RTLS story, from soup to nuts, in the easy to understand For Dummies format. I begin with a tour of the RTLS applications and then serve you the details of what goes into an RTLS and what the various RTLS technologies are. Then, I plunge into the practical things that you need to consider before installing an RTLS and the common pitfalls that you need to be aware of. I include a chapter on evaluating an RTLS solution or selecting an RTLS vendor. And because RTLS security is equally as important as its accuracy, I also include a chapter on possible RTLS hacks and attacks. After reading this book, you’ll know what an RTLS is, how an RTLS is achieved, how to choose the right RTLS technology, and how you can make an RTLS work for you. Like other For Dummies books, this one’s been designed to let you skip around as much as possible. If you don’t want to read this book cover to cover, you don’t have to. Your current knowledge or experience of an RTLS makes some topics more relevant than others. If you want to zero-in on a particular topic, you can use the Table of Contents and index to focus on that coverage.
